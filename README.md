# Wine-Unsupervised-Clustering-Project
In this project, I will use a Wine dataset from Kaggle to build an unsupervised clustering model. I will create a K-Means clustering algorithm to separate data in k clusters based on similar characteristics, such as alcohol content, color intensity, magnesium content and more.
